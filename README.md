# Learn State Machines

Starter files for the Learn State Machines course. 

The code in this repo meant to be a reference point for anyone following along with the video course.

### Getting started
cd into `photobook` and follow along with the videos

You are welcome to submit any pull requests but I'm aiming to keep the code as similar as possible to the course content.

### Code Use
You are welcome to use this code in your own applications. If you would like to use it for training purposes, please shoot me a message first to make sure it's okay.
